Section I: SHORT QUESTIONS (80 points) a) (10 points) True/False
- Except for rare cases, the demand curve is always downward sloping. (True)
- A firm’s average crosses its supply function at the minimum point. (True)
- Membership pricing extracts all surplus from consumers and therefore is always optimal. (False)
- The demand for a product is more elastic when there are more substitutes. (True)

For these types of True/False questions, it's important to understand the underlying economic concepts:

1. **Demand Curve:** Typically, demand curves are downward sloping because as the price of a good decreases, the quantity demanded generally increases, reflecting the law of demand.

2. **Average Cost and Supply Function:** The statement about a firm’s average cost crossing its supply function at the minimum point refers to the typical behavior of cost curves in microeconomics, where the average cost curve intersects the marginal cost curve at its lowest point.

3. **Membership Pricing:** This statement is about pricing strategies. While membership pricing can capture consumer surplus, it is not always optimal due to various market conditions and consumer preferences.

4. **Elasticity and Substitutes:** The elasticity of demand increases with the availability of substitutes because consumers can easily switch to another product if the price of the current product rises.

I hope this helps clarify the concepts behind these True/False statements!
