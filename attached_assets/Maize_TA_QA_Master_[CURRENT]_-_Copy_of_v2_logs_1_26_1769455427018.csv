Here's how you can approach it:

1. **Understand the New Demand Curve**: The demand curve for flights in 2025 is given by \( Q_d(p) = 800 - 20p \). This curve reflects an increase in demand compared to 2021.

2. **Understand the Supply Curve**: The supply function remains the same as in 2021, which is \( Q_s(p) = 300 + 70p \).

3. **Find the Equilibrium**: To find the new equilibrium, set the quantity demanded equal to the quantity supplied:
   \[
   800 - 20p = 300 + 70p
   \]

4. **Solve for Price**: Rearrange the equation to solve for the equilibrium price \( p \).

5. **Calculate the Equilibrium Quantity**: Once you have the equilibrium price, substitute it back into either the demand or supply equation to find the equilibrium quantity.

6. **Consumer Surplus**: To calculate consumer surplus, you'll need to consider the area above the price level and below the demand curve up to the equilibrium quantity.

Remember, the key steps are setting the demand equal to supply to find the equilibrium, solving for price and quantity, and then using those to consider consumer surplus. This approach will give you the new market conditions in 2025.

To start, let's recall the original supply function before the subsidy:
\[ Q_s(p) = 300 + 70p \]

The $2 per-unit subsidy effectively lowers the cost for suppliers, which shifts the supply curve vertically downward by $2. This means the new supply function becomes:
\[ Q_s(p) = 300 + 70(p + 2) \]

Now, you need to find the new equilibrium where this adjusted supply curve intersects with the original demand curve:
\[ Q_d(p) = 600 - 30p \]

To find the equilibrium, set the adjusted supply equal to the demand:
\[ 300 + 70(p + 2) = 600 - 30p \]

Solve this equation for the new equilibrium price \( p \). Once you have the price, substitute it back into either the demand or supply equation to find the equilibrium quantity.

Additionally, to find the total amount of subsidy, multiply the equilibrium quantity by $2 (the subsidy per unit).

For the consumer surplus and deadweight loss, you'll need to understand how these concepts are derived from the demand and supply curves, using the areas under the curves at the equilibrium points. Remember, consumer surplus is the area between the demand curve and the price level up to the quantity traded, and deadweight loss occurs when the market is not operating at maximum efficiency, often due to price controls or subsidies.

   - The world price is given as $10 per pound. With a $7 tariff, analyze how the domestic price might adjust. 

2. **Calculate the Imported Quantity**:
   - With the new domestic price (which is the world price plus the tariff), determine the quantity demanded domestically and the quantity supplied domestically using the demand and supply equations provided.

3. **Tariff Revenue Calculation**:
   - The tariff revenue is the product of the quantity imported and the tariff per unit. 
   - Import quantity can be found as the difference between domestic demand and domestic supply at the new price.

Let's look at problem 7a, which asks about the appropriate economic model to study price competition in the local pizza market between Bombay/6 Ave. Pizza and Joey Pepperoni’s Pizza.

In this scenario, you have two firms (pizza shops) competing on price in a market with homogeneous products (identical pizza). Customers choose the shop with the lower price, and if the prices are the same, the market is split equally between the two. This setup is a classic example of a Bertrand competition model.

The Bertrand model is used to describe interactions among firms that compete by setting prices simultaneously. Key features of the model include:

1. Firms produce homogeneous products.
2. Firms decide on prices simultaneously.
3. Consumers buy from the firm offering the lower price.
4. If the prices are equal, the firms share the market demand equally.

Using the Bertrand model, you can analyze how these firms will set their prices in equilibrium when considering their costs and the behavior of their competitor.

You're asked to determine for what range of \( x \), the value of the A boarding position, the game results in a Prisoners' Dilemma.

To identify a Prisoners’ Dilemma, both players must have a dominant strategy that leads to a worse outcome for both than if they had cooperated. In this context, cooperation would mean both passengers not buying the early check-in, and defection would mean choosing to buy it.

Here's a hint on how to proceed:

1. **Determine the Payoffs**: Calculate the payoffs for each passenger under different scenarios: both buy, neither buys, and one buys while the other doesn't.

2. **Identify Dominant Strategies**: A dominant strategy exists if one strategy provides a higher payoff regardless of what the opponent does. Check if buying or not buying is a dominant strategy for each passenger.

3. **Check for Prisoners' Dilemma Characteristics**:
   - If both passengers buying results in an outcome worse than if neither buys, but buying is still the dominant strategy, you have a Prisoners’ Dilemma.
   - Determine the range of \( x \) where the payoffs align with these conditions.

Use these steps and the definitions provided to analyze the strategies and outcomes for different values of \( x \).

To solve this, you need to calculate the additional profit Producer A would expect to earn by regaining 50% of the market with the certification. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you think through it:

1. **Determine the Increase in Market Share**: With the certification, Producer A regains 50% of the market. You need to calculate the change in profit due to this increase.

2. **Calculate the Profit per Drone**: You would have calculated the profit per drone in earlier parts (such as part c). Use those profits to determine the total profit with the new market share.

3. **Calculate the Additional Profit**: Multiply the increase in market share by the profit per drone to find the additional profit gained from certification.

4. **Determine the Maximum Willingness to Pay**: Producer A would be willing to pay up to the amount of this additional profit for the certification service annually.

Consider the number of potential customers (1 million) in your calculations to find the total additional profit.

To find the Nash Equilibrium, we need to identify the strategy profiles where each firm's strategy is a best response to the strategy chosen by the other firm. This means that neither firm can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.

Given the payoff matrix:

- For 10%: (R&J, 4th Street) = (50, 35), (40, 30), (20, 15)
- For 20%: (52, 20), (45, 27), (25, 15)
- For 30%: (47, 5), (35, 15), (30, 10)

With \( X = 15 \), the relevant entries in the matrix are already filled.

Here's how you can approach finding the Nash Equilibrium:

1. **Eliminate Dominated Strategies**: Check if any strategy for R&J or 4th Street is strictly worse than another, regardless of what the opponent does. This can help simplify the matrix.

2. **Check Best Responses**: For each strategy combination, determine if each firm's strategy is a best response to the other firm's strategy. A strategy is a best response if it maximizes a firm's payoff given the other firm's strategy.

3. **Identify Nash Equilibrium**: Look for a strategy pair where both firms are playing best responses to each other. In such a case, neither firm can unilaterally deviate to achieve a better payoff.

Using these steps, you should be able to identify the Nash Equilibrium in the given payoff matrix.

The question involves understanding how Orange Theory's pricing impacts different types of customers. Here's a breakdown:

Question d) involves two types of membership plans offered by Orange Theory and two types of customers: beginners and hardcore trainers. The hardcore trainers have higher reservation prices and demand more classes than beginners. The question asks about the surplus for hardcore trainers if they choose the Basic plan, given that they have a surplus of $25 with the Elite plan.

To think through this:
- The hardcore trainers are considered ""high types"" in terms of their willingness to pay and demand for classes.
- If Orange Theory is pricing optimally, it means they are setting prices such that hardcore trainers are just indifferent between choosing the Basic and the Elite plan.
- Since the hardcore trainers have a surplus of $25 with the Elite plan, they will have the same surplus with the Basic plan if pricing is optimal, making them indifferent between the two options.

So, the key concept here is understanding how pricing strategies can make different customer segments indifferent between options, which is a common approach in price discrimination to extract maximum consumer surplus.",Good,,MGT_404 2024_final_exam_with_solutions (1).pdf,1,23641,15104,8227,207,1043,doc_type=exam,73,hybrid_full_doc,False,0,0,0.0,0,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[""MGT_404 2024_final_exam (1).pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2024_final_exam_with_solutions (1).pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2024_final_exam_with_solutions (1).pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2024_final_exam (1).pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2024_final_exam_with_solutions (1).pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2024_final_exam (1).pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2024_final_exam_with_solutions (1).pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2024_final_exam_with_solutions (1).pdf|exam|unit:N/A""]",True,llm,12965,0,0,0.5055,"[""No specific question content related to d) from se"", ""No specific question content related to d) from se"", ""Contains question c) but not d) from section 1.""]","[{""idx"": 0, ""file"": ""MGT_404 2024_final_exam (1).pdf"", ""score"": 0.5055, ""text"": ""MGT 404 2023 Final Exam   1  FINAL EXAM Fall 2024   \u2022 This is a closed-book exam.

The problem provides you with the demand and supply functions for the housing market in 2020:
- Demand: \( Q_d(p) = 300 - 100p \)
- Supply: \( Q_s(p) = 50p \)

To find the equilibrium price and quantity, you need to set the demand equal to the supply and solve for \( p \) (the price):

\[ 300 - 100p = 50p \]

Combine the terms involving \( p \) on one side of the equation:

\[ 300 = 150p \]

Now solve for \( p \):

\[ p = \frac{300}{150} \]

Once you have the equilibrium price, substitute this value back into either the demand or supply equation to find the equilibrium quantity. Remember, equilibrium in a market occurs where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.

To calculate the expected value of a job offer, you need to take into account all possible outcomes and their probabilities. For firm Flat, the salary is $95,000 with certainty, so the expected value is straightforward.

For firm P4P, the salary consists of a base salary of $75,000 and a bonus of $45,000 that is given upon reaching a performance target. Your friend believes there is a 50% chance of reaching this target. Therefore, to find the expected value, you calculate the weighted average of the base salary and the bonus:

Expected Value (P4P) = Base Salary + (Probability of Bonus * Bonus Amount).

Use these details to compute the expected values for both job offers and compare them.

Here are the key concepts discussed:

1. **Balance Sheet**: This financial statement lists a company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity at a specific point in time. It follows the fundamental equation: 
   \[
   \text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Equity}
   \]

2. **Assets**: These are economic resources owned or controlled by the firm, expected to bring future benefits, and resulting from past transactions. Assets must be measurable reliably. They are categorized into:
   - **Current Assets**: Expected to be converted into cash within one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer (e.g., cash, inventory, accounts receivable).
   - **Long-Term Assets**: Noncurrent assets like property, plant and equipment (PP&E), long-term investments, and intangible assets.

3. **Liabilities**: These are probable future sacrifices of economic benefits due to present obligations to transfer assets or provide services as a result of past transactions. Liabilities must also be measurable reliably.

4. **Shareholders’ Equity**: This is the residual interest in the assets after deducting liabilities. It represents the ownership interest in the company. The components of equity include:
   - **Paid-In Capital**: Investments made by shareholders, divided into par value of shares and additional paid-in capital (APIC).
   - **Retained Earnings**: The cumulative total of profits retained in the business after dividends are paid.
   - **Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income**: Though not deeply covered, this includes items like foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses.

Understanding these components helps in analyzing a company's financial position and making informed business decisions.",Good,,"Class_2_2025_after_class.pdf, Class_2_2025_after_class.pdf, Class_2_2025_after_class.pdf",8,26245,16579,9366,259,1286,"doc_type=lecture, unit=2",21,filtered,True,8,5,5.75,3,"[8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]","[""Class_2_2025_after_class.pdf|lecture|unit:2"", ""Class_2_2025_after_class.pdf|lecture|unit:2"", ""Class_2_2025_after_class.pdf|lecture|unit:2"", ""Class_2_2025_after_class.pdf|lecture|unit:2"", ""Class_2_2025_after_class.pdf|lecture|unit:2"", ""Class_2_2025_after_class.pdf|lecture|unit:2"", ""Class_2_2025_after_class.pdf|lecture|unit:2"", ""Class_2_2025_after_class.pdf|lecture|unit:2""]",True,llm,15337,8,5,0.3859,"[""Discusses key concepts of balance sheets, assets, "", ""Explains equity and its components, which are key "", ""Contains some key concepts related to liabilities ""]","[{""idx"": 0, ""file"": ""Class_2_2025_after_class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.4148, ""text"": ""y .  \u2022Liability is recognized when: \u2013Future economic obligation    \u2013Result of past transaction or exchange \u2013Must be measured reliably \u2022Equity is defined as a difference between Assets and Liabilities""}, {""idx"": 1, ""file"": ""Class_2_2025_after_class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.3859, ""text"": ""deep about it in  this class.

Here are the key concepts discussed:

1. **Connection between Income Statement and Balance Sheet**:
   - The course revisits how net income links the income statement and balance sheet. Net income affects the retained earnings on the balance sheet, which is calculated as beginning retained earnings plus net income minus dividends declared.

2. **Transaction Analysis**:
   - The course introduces how transactions are analyzed and recorded. Each transaction affects at least two accounts due to the double-entry accounting system. The accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity) must remain balanced after each transaction.

3. **Types of Transactions**:
   - **Explicit Transactions**: These are observable events like cash receipts or credit sales that generate source documents.
   - **Implicit Transactions**: These occur over time and do not generate direct documentation but still require adjusting entries in the accounting records, such as depreciation or accrued interest.

4. **Accruals**:
   - Accruals arise from timing differences between cash flows and revenue or expense recognition. The course covers four types: accounts receivable, payables, deferred revenue, and prepaid expenses.

5. **Journal Entries and T-Accounts**:
   - Each transaction involves listing debits and credits in journal entries and reflecting them in T-accounts. Debits (increases in assets or expenses) are recorded on the left, and credits (increases in liabilities, equity, or revenue) are recorded on the right.

6. **Adjusting Entries**:
   - These are necessary for implicit transactions. Adjusting entries ensure that revenues and expenses are recognized in the correct period, which is crucial for accurate financial reporting.

7. **DIY Financial Statements**:

Here are the key concepts discussed:

1. **Asset Definition**: 
   - According to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), an asset is a probable future economic benefit obtained or controlled by an entity due to past transactions or events. For an item to be recognized on the balance sheet, it must be reliably measurable.

2. **Intangible Assets**:
   - These lack physical existence and are not financial instruments.
   - Intangible assets with a finite life (like patents and copyrights) are amortized over their useful life and tested for impairment.
   - Intangible assets with an indefinite life (like trademarks and goodwill) are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment.
   - Internally developed intangible assets are expensed immediately, with a specific exception for software development costs.

3. **Tangible Assets**:
   - These include physical assets like buildings, equipment, and furniture, which have a finite life.
   - Tangible assets are recorded at their net book value, which is the historical cost minus accumulated depreciation.
   - Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of a long-lived asset over the periods it provides benefits, in line with the matching principle.

4. **Impairments**:
   - An impairment occurs when the net book value of an asset exceeds its fair market value, necessitating a write-down as mandated by US GAAP.
   - Both depreciation and impairments are non-cash expenses.

5. **Goodwill**:
   - Goodwill is only recorded when a business is acquired and is treated similarly to other intangibles with an indefinite life. It is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests.
   - US GAAP prohibits writing up the value of goodwill or any other long-term asset.

These concepts emphasize the importance of accurately valuing and reporting long-lived assets on financial statements, considering factors like depreciation, impairment, and the nature of the asset's life.",Good,,"Class_6_2025_after_class.pdf, Class_6_2025_after_class.pdf, Class_6_2025_after_class.pdf",8,26392,15798,10273,314,1286,"doc_type=lecture, unit=6",28,filtered,True,10,5,5.625,5,"[10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]","[""Class_6_2025_after_class.pdf|lecture|unit:6"", ""Class_6_2025_after_class.pdf|lecture|unit:6"", ""Class_6_2025_after_class.pdf|lecture|unit:6"", ""Class_6_2025_after_class.pdf|lecture|unit:6"", ""Class_6_2025_after_class.pdf|lecture|unit:6"", ""Class_6_2025_after_class.pdf|lecture|unit:6"", ""Class_6_2025_after_class.pdf|lecture|unit:6"", ""Class_6_2025_after_class.pdf|lecture|unit:6""]",True,llm,15242,10,5,0.3725,"[""Recaps asset definitions and key concepts directly"", ""Discusses intangible assets and key accounting pri"", ""Explains net book value and depreciation, which ar""]","[{""idx"": 0, ""file"": ""Class_6_2025_after_class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.4084, ""text"": ""Intangible Assets developed internally : expense immediately \u2022General Rule for R&D: expense when incurred \u2022Exception: Software Development Costs \u2022 Goodwill: recorded only when a business is acquired \u2022""}, {""idx"": 1, ""file"": ""Class_6_2025_after_class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.3912, ""text"": ""are generally recorded at their net book value: the original historical cost  minus accumulated depreciation (amortization for intangible assets) Historical cost                    Acquisition cost  (""}, {""idx"": 2, ""file"": ""Class_6_2025_after_class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.3895, ""text"": ""inite life: \u2013PP&E: Buildings,  equipment, furniture, etc. INTANGIBLE No Physical Substance \u2022Indefinite life: \u2013Trademarks, goodwill  \u2022Finite life: \u2013Patents, trade names,  copyrights, franchises,  etc.""}, {""idx"": 3, ""file"": ""Class_6_2025_after_class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.3749, ""text"": ""inite life: \u2013PP&E: Buildings,  equipment, furniture, etc. INTANGIBLE No Physical Substance \u2022Indefinite life: \u2013Trademarks, goodwill  \u2022Finite life: \u2013Patents, trade names,  copyrights, franchises,  etc.""}, {""idx"": 4, ""file"": ""Class_6_2025_after_class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.3725, ""text"": ""MGT 402: Basics of Accounting Long -lived Assets Anya Nakhmurina Fall 1 2025 Class 6  Recap: Asset Definition \u2022FASB: Probable future economic benefits obtained or controlled by a particular entity as""}, {""idx"": 5, ""file"": ""Class_6_2025_after_class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.3686, ""text"": ""Impairments \u2022Depreciation  \u2022PP&E is an asset that will generate future benefits (revenues).

Here are the key concepts covered:

1. **Cash Flow Statement (CFS)**: This statement explains changes in cash between two consecutive balance sheets and classifies cash receipts and payments according to a company's main economic activities: operating, investing, and financing activities.

2. **Accrual Accounting**: This method captures the timing of underlying economic transactions rather than the timing of related cash flows. It requires recording revenue when earned and expenses when incurred, regardless of when the cash transactions occur. This is why the Cash Flow Statement is necessary to show actual cash inflows and outflows.

3. **Operating Activities (CFO)**: These are activities directly related to earning income. The course emphasized two methods to calculate CFO:
   - **Direct Method**: Lists cash receipts and cash payments for each major operating activity.
   - **Indirect Method**: Adjusts Net Income to reflect only cash receipts and payments related to operating activities.

4. **Indirect Method in Detail**:
   - Start with Net Income (NI).
   - **Adjustments from the Income Statement**:
     - Add non-cash expenses (e.g., Depreciation).
     - Subtract non-operating gains (e.g., Gain on sale of property).
   - **Adjustments from the Balance Sheet**:
     - Adjust for changes in operating assets (e.g., Accounts Receivable, Inventory) by subtracting the change.
     - Adjust for changes in operating liabilities (e.g., Accounts Payable) by adding the change.

5. **Comparing Direct vs. Indirect Method**: While both methods ultimately result in the same amount of CFO, companies are required to report using the indirect method. The direct method is voluntary and less commonly used.

6. **Examples and Exercises**: The class included examples of how to apply these concepts using hypothetical scenarios with XYZ, Inc., which demonstrated the application of direct and indirect methods to specific accounting situations.

Understanding these concepts helps in constructing a Cash Flow Statement and analyzing the cash position of a business effectively.",Good,,Class_8_2025_in_class.pdf,1,26379,13515,12545,333,1286,"doc_type=lecture, unit=8",27,hybrid_full_doc,True,5,5,5.0,0,"[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]","[""Class_8_2025_in_class.pdf|lecture|unit:8"", ""Class_8_2025_in_class.pdf|lecture|unit:8"", ""Class_8_2025_in_class.pdf|lecture|unit:8"", ""Class_8_2025_in_class.pdf|lecture|unit:8"", ""Class_8_2025_in_class.pdf|lecture|unit:8"", ""Class_8_2025_in_class.pdf|lecture|unit:8"", ""Class_8_2025_in_class.pdf|lecture|unit:8"", ""Class_8_2025_in_class.pdf|lecture|unit:8""]",True,llm,12302,5,5,0.4217,"[""Contains general concepts related to cash flow sta"", ""Discusses constructing cash flow statements, relev"", ""Mentions cash flow statement construction and key ""]","[{""idx"": 0, ""file"": ""Class_8_2025_in_class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.4217, ""text"": ""Cash from Financing    Net Cash =  + BB Cash    EB CashIncome Statement    Revenues - Expenses  + Gains - Losses     Net IncomeEquity Statement Explains all changes in SE   over an accounting period""}, {""idx"": 1, ""file"": ""Class_8_2025_in_class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.397, ""text"": ""nt: see handouts Construct CFS using Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and the footnotes provided Do not forget to make sure that change in cash on your CFS = change in cash account on  balance sheet.""}, {""idx"": 2, ""file"": ""Class_8_2025_in_class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.3825, ""text"": ""le, Tax payable)Construct CFS using Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and  the footnotes provided Do not forget to make sure that change in cash on your  CFS = change in cash account on balance sheet.""}, {""idx"": 3, ""file"": ""Class_8_2025_in_class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.3819, ""text"": ""MGT 402: Basics of Accounting Cash Flow Statement II Anya Nakhmurina Fall 1 202 5 Class 8  Last class: Cash Flow Statement Balance Sheet XX/XX/20XX Assets:  Current Assets:   Cash   Inventory \u2026 Long -""}, {""idx"": 4, ""file"": ""Class_8_2025_in_class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.3638, ""text"": ""uired to report the indirect method \u2013Direct method is voluntary; most firms do not report it;  \u2022all firms must disclose cash paid for taxes \u2022CFI and CFF are computed identically under the two methods""}, {""idx"": 5, ""file"": ""Class_8_2025_in_class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.3633, ""text"": ""ments  -Income Statement reflects revenues, expenses, gains,  and losses for the period (these could be, but are not  necessarily cash) -Cash Flow Statement exists to count cash inflows and  outflows""}, {""idx"": 6, ""file"": ""Class_8_2025_in_class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.346, ""text"": ""penses (e.g., Depreciation, Amortization, Stock -based compensation expense) 2.

Let's go through how you would book transaction a) in T-accounts for Grow Co.

Transaction a) states: ""Sales were $501.7, all made on account.""

1. **Identify the accounts involved**:
   - **Accounts Receivable**: This account will increase because the sales were made on account, meaning customers have not yet paid in cash.
   - **Sales Revenue**: This account will increase because the company generated sales.

2. **Determine the impact on each account**:
   - **Accounts Receivable (Asset)**: Since sales were made on account, Accounts Receivable will increase by $501.7 million.
   - **Sales Revenue (Revenue)**: Sales Revenue will increase by $501.7 million, reflecting the sales made during the period.

3. **Record the transaction in T-accounts**:
   - **Accounts Receivable**:
     - Debit $501.7 million (increase in asset)
   - **Sales Revenue**:
     - Credit $501.7 million (increase in revenue)

This reflects the increase in accounts receivable due to sales on credit and the recognition of sales revenue.

**T-accounts**:

- **Accounts Receivable**:
  ```
  | Debit        | Credit
  |--------------|--------
  | $501.7       |
  ```

- **Sales Revenue**:
  ```
  | Debit        | Credit
  |--------------|--------
  |              | $501.7
  ```

Let's go through transaction h) step by step to understand how it would be recorded in T-accounts.

Transaction h) states: ""Interest expense was $15.9.""

When recording this transaction in T-accounts, you need to consider two main accounts:

1. **Interest Expense Account**: This is an expense account that will increase with this transaction.
2. **Cash or Interest Payable Account**: Depending on whether the interest was paid immediately or is to be paid later, you will either decrease Cash or increase Interest Payable.

Here's how you can think about booking this transaction:

- **Interest Expense Account**: 
  - Since expenses increase with debits, you will debit the Interest Expense account by $15.9 million.

- **Cash or Interest Payable**:
  - If the interest was paid in cash, you would credit the Cash account by $15.9 million because asset accounts decrease with credits.
  - If the interest is to be paid later, you would instead credit the Interest Payable account by $15.9 million because liability accounts increase with credits.

It's important to note that in transaction h), it doesn't specify whether the interest was paid immediately or is payable. However, based on the course material you have, if there is additional information that specifies this, you would use the appropriate account (Cash or Interest Payable) for the credit entry.

Remember, when you set up your T-accounts, the left side is for debits and the right side is for credits.",Good,,Class 5. Grow Co. I.pdf,1,13998,2180,11485,235,1286,"filename=Class 5. Grow Co.

Problem 2 from Self-Study Problem Set #4 involves designing a distribution system for Dale Computer, Inc. The aim is to determine how to ship computers from assembly plants to east coast markets in a cost-effective manner. Let's break it down:

### Key Components of the Problem:

1. **Plants and Markets:**
   - **Plants:** Austin, Texas and San Jose, California.
   - **Markets:** Boston, New York, and Washington D.C.

2. **Demand:**
   - Boston: 6,000 units
   - New York: 11,000 units
   - Washington D.C.: 4,000 units

3. **Production:**
   - Austin: 14,000 units
   - San Jose: 7,000 units

4. **Terminal Locations:**
   - Chicago, Omaha, and Memphis

5. **Costs:**
   - Shipping costs from plants to terminals and from terminals to markets.
   - Fixed annual costs for setting up and maintaining terminals.

### Formulation Steps:

#### 1. **Define Decision Variables:**
   - Let \( x_{ij} \) represent the number of units shipped from plant \( i \) to terminal \( j \).
   - Let \( y_{jk} \) represent the number of units shipped from terminal \( j \) to market \( k \).
   - Let \( z_j \) be a binary variable indicating whether terminal \( j \) is open (1) or closed (0).

#### 2. **Objective Function:**
   - Minimize total cost, which includes shipment costs and fixed costs for open terminals.

#### 3. **Constraints:**
   - **Supply Constraints:** Total units shipped from each plant should not exceed its production capacity.
   - **Demand Constraints:** Each market's demand must be fully met.
   - **Terminal Constraints:** Cannot ship through a terminal unless it is open.
   - **Back-hauling Constraint:** For Austin to Memphis, only up to 3,000 units can be shipped at no cost.

#### 4. **Incorporate Fixed Costs:**
   - Fixed costs are added to the objective function based on whether each terminal is open.

### Approach:

- **Step 1:** Formulate a network flow problem ignoring fixed costs initially. This helps in understanding the flow of goods.
  
- **Step 2:** Introduce binary variables for terminal opening and include fixed costs in the objective function.
  
- **Step 3:** Add constraints to ensure terminals are only used when they are open.

By setting up the problem this way, you can use a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach to find the optimal distribution plan. Make sure to use software tools like LINGO, Gurobi, or Excel Solver to handle the computational aspect as this involves solving a mixed-integer program.

According to the course material on risk and prospect theory, framing can influence whether someone is risk-averse or risk-seeking. Here's a breakdown of the concept:

1. **Reference Points**: Outcomes are evaluated as gains or losses relative to a reference point. This reference point divides the world into perceived ""gains"" and ""losses.""

2. **Gain vs. Loss Frames**: 
   - **Gain Frame**: People tend to be risk-averse when outcomes are framed as gains. For example, preferring a sure gain over a gamble that could lead to either a larger gain or nothing.
   - **Loss Frame**: Conversely, people are generally risk-seeking when outcomes are framed as losses. For instance, preferring a gamble to avoid a sure loss, even if it might lead to a larger loss.

3. **Losses Loom Larger**: The material also states that losses tend to have a more significant emotional impact than gains, roughly twice as much.

4. **Examples**: 
   - The survey on vaccines demonstrates this. When framed as saving lives (a gain), people preferred the sure option. When framed as avoiding deaths (a loss), people preferred the risky option.
   - Decision framing impacts how risks are perceived and can influence choices in different scenarios, like financial decisions or health-related choices.

In essence, framing alters the perception of risk and can lead to different decisions even if the underlying probabilities are unchanged. Understanding how framing affects decision-making can help in taking smarter risks by consciously adjusting the reference points.",Good,,Risk Slides 2025 (1).pdf,1,23629,14953,8362,256,370,,0,hybrid_full_doc,True,5,0,1.25,5,"[5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[""Risk Slides 2025 (1).pdf|lecture|unit:N/A"", ""Risk Slides 2025 (1).pdf|lecture|unit:N/A"", ""Short Ford Pinto.docx|reading|unit:N/A"", ""lect02 (1).pdf|lecture|unit:2"", ""Risk Slides 2025 (1).pdf|lecture|unit:N/A"", ""lect06 (1).pdf|lecture|unit:6"", ""ss#3.pdf|homework|unit:N/A"", ""Human vs. Statistical DM (1).pdf|lecture|unit:N/A""]",True,llm,12637,5,0,0.2902,"[""Discusses framing in the context of risk and decis"", ""Related to decision-making and outcomes but does n"", ""Not relevant to the concept of framing.""]","[{""idx"": 0, ""file"": ""Risk Slides 2025 (1).pdf"", ""score"": 0.2902, ""text"": ""Psychology  Vaccine ExampleGain FrameRP = 0 saved(+) Risk-averseLoss FrameRP = 30,000 saved (status quo)(-) Risk-seekingValue# of Lives(-)(+) (-)(+)030K10K20K  Reference points operate AUTOMATICALLY!""}, {""idx"": 1, ""file"": ""Short Ford Pinto.docx"", ""score"": 0.2423, ""text"": ""Prof. Cain says, \u201cDon't let the 1970s origins of this case fool you\u2014it\u2019s as relevant today as ever.

It represents the change in the optimal objective function value (OFV) when the right-hand side (RHS) of a constraint is relaxed by one unit. 

In simpler terms, the shadow price tells you how much the value of the objective function (like profit or cost) would improve if you could increase the availability of a constrained resource by one unit. 

There are two main scenarios to consider regarding shadow prices:

1. **Shadow Price is Not Zero**: This means the constraint is binding. In this case, the optimal solution is dependent on that constraint, and any changes within the allowable increase or decrease will affect the solution.

2. **Shadow Price is Zero**: This means the constraint is not binding, so the current optimal solution isn't affected by small changes in that constraint. The optimal solution will remain the same until the constraint becomes binding.

Understanding shadow prices helps in answering ""what if"" questions about resource changes and assessing the marginal value of resources in decision-making models.",Good,,"lect03 (2).pdf, lect03 (2).pdf, lect07 (1).pdf",8,24810,19126,5356,176,370,,0,unfiltered,True,10,5,5.625,5,"[10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]","[""lect03 (2).pdf|lecture|unit:3"", ""lect03 (2).pdf|lecture|unit:3"", ""lect07 (1).pdf|lecture|unit:7"", ""lect06 (1).pdf|lecture|unit:6"", ""lect03 (2).pdf|lecture|unit:3"", ""lect03 (2).pdf|lecture|unit:3"", ""lect03 (2).pdf|lecture|unit:3"", ""lect03 (2).pdf|lecture|unit:3""]",True,llm,17618,10,5,0.4212,"[""Provides a clear definition of shadow price in rel"", ""Mentions shadow price but lacks a clear definition"", ""Discusses shadow prices in a cash flow context but""]","[{""idx"": 0, ""file"": ""lect03 (2).pdf"", ""score"": 0.5545, ""text"": ""the  shadow price will decrease \u2022If the constraint is changed to  restrict the feasible region beyond the allowable limit,  the shadow price will increase5,389.00 6,583.332,000 4,000 8,000pounds of  a""}, {""idx"": 1, ""file"": ""lect07 (1).pdf"", ""score"": 0.5003, ""text"": ""74325 1.03000 0 1E+30 197.743 MGT 405: Modeling Managerial DecisionsInterpretation of cash flow balance shadow prices     Time Shadow Price  ft 1-period growth  rate rt1 compounded  growth rate r t2""}, {""idx"": 2, ""file"": ""lect06 (1).pdf"", ""score"": 0.481, ""text"": ""test benefit from increased demand?  \u2022Can you intuitively explain why the shadow price for supply in Tokyo is so high?Constraints Final Shadow Constraint Allowable Allowable Cell Name Value Price R.H.""}, {""idx"": 3, ""file"": ""lect03 (2).pdf"", ""score"": 0.4796, ""text"": ""emained (4,25), then the OFV would still equal 1,660.) \u2022Thus for the RHS of a constraint, if the shadow price is nonzero, then the optimal solution  WILL change within the allowable increase/decrease.""}, {""idx"": 4, ""file"": ""lect03 (2).pdf"", ""score"": 0.4593, ""text"": ""nstraint beyond its allowable limit, the shadow price will increase. \u2022In Domaine Paul Autard, the shadow price for Grenache increases to 100 if you  tighten the constraint beyond 15 (a decrease of 2)""}, {""idx"": 5, ""file"": ""lect03 (2).pdf"", ""score"": 0.4581, ""text"": ""13 brazil nuts) LHS 7,250.00     -          7500 1E+30 250 $E$14 filberts) LHS 7,250.00     -          7500 1E+30 250 Constraints Final Shadow Constraint Allowable Allowable Cell Name Value Price R.H.""}, {""idx"": 6, ""file"": ""lect03 (2).pdf"", ""score"": 0.4541, ""text"": ""le \u2013 indicates how much more attractive (i.e., higher in profit or lower in cost) its  coefficient in the objective function must be before this variable is worth using. \u2013 Ignore the sign (trust us!).""}, {""idx"": 7, ""file"": ""lect07 (1).pdf"", ""score"": 0.4451, ""text"": ""ionsSpreadsheet solution Page 10 9 10  8/25/2025 6 MGT 405: Modeling Managerial DecisionsLP sensitivity report Page 11Constraints Final Shadow Constraint Allowable Allowable Cell Name Value Price R.H.""}, {""idx"": 8, ""file"": ""ss#2sol.pdf"", ""score"": 0.4365, ""text"": ""ies of each of the nuts are completely utilized in the optimal solution.

Here's how you can approach the problem:

1. **Understanding Net Returns**: The net return for each quarter is given as a percentage. For example, a 6% net return in the first quarter means that if you started with $1, your investment would grow to $1.06 by the end of the first quarter.

2. **Sequential Multiplication**: Since dividends are reinvested, you can calculate the cumulative effect of these quarterly returns by multiplying them sequentially:
   - Convert each percentage return to a decimal and add 1 (e.g., 6% becomes 1.06).
   - Multiply the adjusted returns for each quarter together to find the overall growth factor for the year.

3. **Formula**: The formula for the cumulative return over the year is:
   \[
   (1 + \text{Q1 return}) \times (1 + \text{Q2 return}) \times (1 + \text{Q3 return}) \times (1 + \text{Q4 return}) - 1
   \]

4. **Example Calculation**: Using the given returns:
   - Q1: 6% → 1.06
   - Q2: -4% → 0.96
   - Q3: 5% → 1.05
   - Q4: -2% → 0.98

Here's a breakdown to help you understand these concepts:

1. **Standard Deviation/Variance:** This measure captures the total risk of a stock, which includes both systematic risk (market-related risk) and idiosyncratic risk (stock-specific risk). It's a measure of how much the returns of a stock deviate from its average return. A higher standard deviation indicates greater volatility, meaning the stock's returns can vary widely.

2. **Beta (β):** In the CAPM framework, beta measures only the systematic risk of a stock. It represents the sensitivity of a stock's returns to the returns of the overall market. A beta greater than 1 implies that the stock is more volatile than the market, while a beta less than 1 implies it is less volatile.

When comparing these two measures in the context of assessing the risk of a stock:

- **Standard Deviation** is useful when you want a comprehensive view of the stock's overall volatility, including both market and stock-specific factors.
- **Beta** is more relevant in the CAPM context because it focuses on the risk that cannot be diversified away – the market risk. This is particularly important for investors who are concerned with how a stock contributes to the risk of a diversified portfolio.

In summary, if you are thinking about risk in terms of how a stock behaves in relation to the market, then beta is more meaningful. If you're interested in the stock's total volatility, standard deviation might make more sense. Understanding the context in which you're evaluating risk will help determine which measure is more appropriate.",Good,,hw3.pdf,1,12959,955,11691,289,491,"doc_type=homework, assignment=3",4,hybrid_full_doc,True,0.4838,0.3202,0.3984,0.1636,"[0.4838, 0.4344, 0.3552, 0.3202]","[""hw3.pdf|homework|unit:5"", ""hw3.pdf|homework|unit:5"", ""hw3.pdf|homework|unit:5"", ""hw3.pdf|homework|unit:5""]",False,none,,,,,[],"[{""idx"": 0, ""file"": ""hw3.pdf"", ""score"": 0.4838, ""text"": ""INVESTOR (Jensen and Fontanier) Homework Assignment 3 Please note: \u0088Do the homework in your small, 4-person learning team. \u0088The homework covers Lecture Note 5; you should therefore review that lecture""}, {""idx"": 1, ""file"": ""hw3.pdf"", ""score"": 0.4344, ""text"": ""e team. \u0088Please use the file name structure \u201ccohort group homeworknumber.pdf\u201d (e.g., \u201cblue 4bHW1.pdf\u201d) for your submission. \u0088Make sure that the assignment you submit is formatted for easy printing. 1""}, {""idx"": 2, ""file"": ""hw3.pdf"", ""score"": 0.3552, ""text"": ""ence is.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you understand how to approach this problem:

1. **Understand the Concept**: You are dealing with two interest rates over two periods. The first is the 1-year spot rate, which you will use for the first year. The second is the futures rate (\( f_{1,2} \)), which you will lock in for the second year.

2. **Initial Investment**: Assume you invest an initial amount for one year. The amount at the end of the first year can be calculated using the 1-year spot rate.

3. **Future Rate Application**: At the end of the first year, the amount you have is then invested for another year using the futures rate (\( f_{1,2} \)).

4. **Mathematical Expression**: You need to express this process mathematically. Let’s say you start with an amount \( P \). After the first year, your investment grows to \( P \times (1 + r_1) \), where \( r_1 \) is the 1-year spot rate. In the second year, this amount is reinvested at the rate \( f_{1,2} \), resulting in a payoff of \( P \times (1 + r_1) \times (1 + f_{1,2}) \) after two years.

This expression provides a formulaic way to determine your payoff given the rates, without needing the numerical value of \( f_{1,2} \) yet.

Let's break down question 3a from the 2023 final exam. The question involves the calculation of alpha using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and finding that the alpha is positive. You are asked to give at least two potential explanations for this positive alpha.

Firstly, let's understand what alpha is in the context of CAPM:
- Alpha represents the excess return of an investment compared to the return predicted by the CAPM. A positive alpha suggests that the investment has outperformed the expected return given its risk (beta).

Here are two potential bullet-point explanations for a positive alpha:
- **Mispricing**: The market might not be fully efficient, and the mutual fund could be exploiting this inefficiency to generate returns higher than what CAPM would predict.
- **Manager Skill**: The fund manager might possess superior skills or information, allowing them to pick stocks or time the market more effectively than the average investor, leading to higher returns.

Let's break down question 2b from the 2024 final exam, which involves calculating the expected return and standard deviation for a portfolio composed of the Market and NVDA, and then finding the mean-variance utility with a given risk aversion level.

### Step 1: Calculate the Expected Portfolio Return

You have a portfolio with 40% in the Market and 60% in NVDA. The expected returns for the Market and NVDA are given as 7% and 7.6%, respectively. The formula for the expected return of a portfolio (\(E(r_p)\)) is:

\[ E(r_p) = w_1 \times E(r_1) + w_2 \times E(r_2) \]

where:
- \(w_1\) and \(w_2\) are the weights of the Market and NVDA in the portfolio.
- \(E(r_1)\) and \(E(r_2)\) are the expected returns of the Market and NVDA.

### Step 2: Calculate the Portfolio Standard Deviation

The standard deviation of a two-asset portfolio is given by:

\[ \sigma_p = \sqrt{w_1^2 \times \sigma_1^2 + w_2^2 \times \sigma_2^2 + 2 \times w_1 \times w_2 \times \text{Cov}(1,2)} \]

where:
- \(\sigma_1\) and \(\sigma_2\) are the standard deviations of the Market and NVDA.
- \(\text{Cov}(1,2)\) is the covariance between the Market and NVDA, given as 0.027.

### Step 3: Calculate the Mean-Variance Utility

The mean-variance utility of a portfolio is calculated using the formula:

\[ U = E(r_p) - \frac{\gamma}{2} \times \sigma_p^2 \]

where:
- \(\gamma\) is the investor's risk aversion coefficient (given as 2).

Now, apply these formulas step-by-step to compute each of these values.

The framework identifies five key forces that shape the intensity of competition and, consequently, the profitability of an industry. In the course material, a sixth force is also considered, making it 6 forces. Here’s a brief overview of each:

1. **Threat of New Entrants**: This force examines how easy or difficult it is for new competitors to enter the industry. Factors such as capital requirements, access to distribution channels, and regulatory barriers play a role here. High threats can limit profitability as new entrants increase competition.

2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**: This force analyzes how much power suppliers have to drive up prices. If there are few suppliers or if they offer unique products, they have more power over the industry, potentially squeezing margins.

3. **Rivalry Among Competitors**: This force looks at the intensity of competition among existing firms in the industry. High rivalry can result from numerous competitors, slow industry growth, or lack of differentiation, often leading to price wars and reduced profitability.

4. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**: This force considers the power customers have to affect prices and quality. If buyers have many choices or purchase in large volumes, they can demand lower prices or higher product quality, impacting industry profitability.

5. **Threat of Substitutes**: This force evaluates the presence of alternative products or services that can fulfill the same need. High threat of substitutes can limit the potential for price increases and profitability.

6. **Complements**: This additional force, though not originally part of Porter’s framework, is included in the course material. Complements are products or services that enhance the value of the industry’s offerings. Their presence can increase demand and profitability.

The course material also mentions additional considerations like government/regulation and technology, which can influence these forces and the overall strategic environment. Understanding these forces helps firms define their strategy and find a position that maximizes their share of industry profits.",Good,,"Industry_Analysis_Class.pdf, Overview.pdf, Industry_Analysis_Class.pdf",8,31112,19293,11497,330,498,,0,unfiltered,True,10,0,3.75,10,"[10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]","[""Industry_Analysis_Class.pdf|lecture|unit:N/A"", ""Overview.pdf|lecture|unit:N/A"", ""Industry_Analysis_Class.pdf|lecture|unit:N/A"", ""Industry_Analysis_Class.pdf|lecture|unit:N/A"", ""Antitrust_notes.pdf|lecture|unit:N/A"", ""Industry_Analysis_Class.pdf|lecture|unit:N/A"", ""Overview.pdf|lecture|unit:N/A"", ""Product_Diff_Class.pdf|lecture|unit:N/A""]",True,llm,16920,10,0,0.4159,"[""Directly lists and defines Porter\u2019s 5 Forces."", ""References Porter\u2019s 5 Forces but lacks detailed ex"", ""Mentions industry analysis and market power but do""]","[{""idx"": 0, ""file"": ""Industry_Analysis_Class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.5013, ""text"": ""Industry Analysis / 5 Forces Kevin Williams MGT 410: Competitor  Last time \u2022Double marginalization is the result of multiple layers of market power in the  vertical chain.  \u2022At each level, there is a""}, {""idx"": 1, ""file"": ""Overview.pdf"", ""score"": 0.47, ""text"": ""rstanding of  strategic incentives facing a firm \u2022We\u2019ll then leverage Porter\u2019s 5 Forces to summarize competitive forces in entire industries, or the  average performance of  a firm in a given market""}, {""idx"": 2, ""file"": ""Industry_Analysis_Class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.4219, ""text"": ""igh( ish) prices even with more firms? \u2022What mechanisms keep the prices up? \u2022Does this industry succumb to fierce price competition even with a few firms? \u2022What mechanisms lead to fierce competition?""}, {""idx"": 3, ""file"": ""Industry_Analysis_Class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.4159, ""text"": ""rofits  Porter\u2019s 5 Forces Threat of  New  Entrants Bargaining Power  of  Suppliers Rivalry Among  Competitors Bargaining Power  of  Buyers Substitutes Complements Government /  Regulation Technology""}, {""idx"": 4, ""file"": ""Overview.pdf"", ""score"": 0.4132, ""text"": ""stocked  relative to the customer creates cost advantages \u2022In some markets, the manufacturer can stipulate downstream prices,  e.g., with resale price maintenance, meaning the vertical chain matters""}, {""idx"": 5, ""file"": ""Product_Diff_Class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.4093, ""text"": ""cR2(P1) R1(P2) 1 2 8Key: These forces extend to  all forms of product  differentiation, not just  distance costs  Note: This is like the  Bertrand group, but with the  BR curves bowed outEquilibrium!""}, {""idx"": 6, ""file"": ""Industry_Analysis_Class.pdf"", ""score"": 0.4093, ""text"": ""need to be careful and define the  market that suits our purpose \u2022Porter\u2019s 5 Forces can help correct for  being too broad or narrow , but only to a  certain extent \u2022Market definition is a key input""}, {""idx"": 7, ""file"": ""Overview.pdf"", ""score"": 0.3997, ""text"": "") Factors disciplining competitive interactions: \u2022Double marginalization \u2022Vertical integration \u2022Antitrust (after break) \u2022Competition and  Co-opetition \u2022Quantitative  information and      competition""}, {""idx"": 8, ""file"": ""Competitor 2025_Dec 2, 2025..pdf"", ""score"": 0.3869, ""text"": ""among wholesale price, retail price, and marginal cost)?

In this model, each firm makes an assumption about how much the other firms will produce and then decides its own production level to maximize its profit.

Here's a basic rundown of how Cournot competition works:

1. **Assumptions**: Each firm chooses its quantity to maximize profit, given the quantity chosen by its competitors. The firms make their decisions simultaneously.

2. **Market Demand**: The market demand curve, which shows the relationship between the total quantity produced by all firms and the market price, is critical in determining the outcome of Cournot competition.

3. **Reaction Functions**: Each firm has a reaction function, which tells it the profit-maximizing quantity to produce given the quantity produced by the other firm(s).

4. **Equilibrium**: A Cournot equilibrium occurs when each firm is producing the quantity that maximizes its profit, given the quantities chosen by the other firms. At this point, no firm has an incentive to unilaterally change its production.

**Example**: Imagine two companies, A and B, that produce a homogenous product. The demand for the product is represented by the equation \(P = 100 - Q\), where \(P\) is the price and \(Q\) is the total quantity supplied \(Q = q_A + q_B\).

- **Cost Structure**: Suppose each firm has the same cost function \(C(q) = 10q\).

- **Reaction Functions**: Firm A's profit is \(\pi_A = (100 - q_A - q_B)q_A - 10q_A\). To find the reaction function, Firm A would maximize \(\pi_A\) with respect to \(q_A\), given \(q_B\). Similarly, Firm B would do the same to determine its reaction function.

The equilibrium is reached when both firms produce quantities such that neither can increase profit by changing their output, given the output of the other.

The Cournot model helps illustrate how firms in an oligopoly might behave and shows the interdependencies of firms' decisions in competitive markets.",Good,,exam_competitor_2024_without solutions.pdf,1,24341,9694,14346,333,498,doc_type=exam,37,hybrid_full_doc,True,0,0,0.0,0,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[""exam_competitor_2024_without solutions.pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""exam_competitor_2024_without solutions.pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""exam_competitor_2024_without solutions.pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""exam_competitor_2024_without solutions.pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""exam_competitor_2024_without solutions.pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""exam_competitor_2024_without solutions.pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""exam_competitor_2024_without solutions.pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""exam_competitor_2024_without solutions.pdf|exam|unit:N/A""]",True,llm,8367,0,0,0.5296,"[""Does not mention Cournot competition or quantity c"", ""Irrelevant to Cournot competition."", ""Irrelevant to Cournot competition.""]","[{""idx"": 0, ""file"": ""exam_competitor_2024_without solutions.pdf"", ""score"": 0.5296, ""text"": ""ollusive quantity without the presence of a formal cartel.      b) [5 points]  In the two following two scenarios, discuss how likely the strategies you describe in  part a) can be successful and why.""}, {""idx"": 1, ""file"": ""exam_competitor_2024_without solutions.pdf"", ""score"": 0.511, ""text"": ""(a).

This means neither firm has the opportunity to move first and influence the other's decision directly.

However, in the Stackelberg model, which is a variant of Cournot competition, there is a clear first-mover advantage. In the Stackelberg model, one firm (the leader) commits to a quantity first, and the other firm (the follower) reacts to this decision. The leader uses this advantage to commit to a higher quantity, knowing that the follower will have to adjust its output in response. This strategic commitment allows the leader to capture a larger market share and achieve higher profits compared to the follower.

In summary, while the Cournot model itself doesn't feature a first-mover advantage due to its simultaneous nature, the Stackelberg model, which involves sequential moves, clearly illustrates this advantage by allowing the leader to influence the market outcome favorably.",Good,,"Cournot Stackelberg (2).pdf, Cournot Stackelberg (2).pdf, Cournot Stackelberg (2).pdf",8,20736,14395,6042,165,498,"filename=Cournot Stackelberg (2).pdf, match_score=0.6",22,filtered,True,10,3,5.375,7,"[10, 7, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 3]","[""Cournot Stackelberg (2).pdf|lecture|unit:N/A"", ""Cournot Stackelberg (2).pdf|lecture|unit:N/A"", ""Cournot Stackelberg (2).pdf|lecture|unit:N/A"", ""Cournot Stackelberg (2).pdf|lecture|unit:N/A"", ""Cournot Stackelberg (2).pdf|lecture|unit:N/A"", ""Cournot Stackelberg (2).pdf|lecture|unit:N/A"", ""Cournot Stackelberg (2).pdf|lecture|unit:N/A"", ""Cournot Stackelberg (2).pdf|lecture|unit:N/A""]",True,llm,12740,10,3,0.593,"[""Directly explains how the first mover advantage wo"", ""Discusses first mover advantage in the context of "", ""Mentions first mover advantage but lacks detailed ""]","[{""idx"": 0, ""file"": ""Cournot Stackelberg (2).pdf"", ""score"": 0.6738, ""text"": ""rg  model, however, firm 1 knows  that if it produces more, firm 2 will respond  to it and  produce less, and thus \ud835\udc5e1\ud835\udc46>\ud835\udc5e1\ud835\udc36.  \u2022This ability allows firm 1 to have more market power and gets more profit.""}, {""idx"": 1, ""file"": ""Cournot Stackelberg (2).pdf"", ""score"": 0.6317, ""text"": ""e product is entirely undifferentiated.
