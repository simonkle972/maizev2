The question is: 

""The state of Illinois increased its tax rate on cigarette by almost 200% in 2019. Among smokers (assuming they don’t quit immediately), non-smokers, and tobacco companies, which group would bear the highest percentage of tax incidents? Why?""

To understand who bears the highest percentage of tax incidence, we need to consider the concept of elasticity of demand. Tax incidence refers to how the burden of a tax is distributed between consumers and producers. 

In this case, smokers have a highly inelastic demand for cigarettes. This means that their quantity demanded does not significantly decrease even when the price increases due to the tax. Because of this inelasticity, smokers will bear the majority of the tax burden. 

Non-smokers are not directly affected by the tax on cigarettes, and tobacco companies might pass some of the tax burden onto consumers. However, due to the inelastic nature of smokers' demand, they will end up bearing the highest percentage of the tax incidence.

The question is:

""The state of Illinois increased its tax rate on cigarette by almost 200% in 2019. Among smokers (assuming they don’t quit immediately), non-smokers, and tobacco companies, which group would bear the highest percentage of tax incidents? Why?""

To understand this, consider the concept of tax incidence, which refers to how the burden of a tax is distributed between consumers and producers. In this case, the key factor is the elasticity of demand and supply. 

- **Elasticity of Demand**: If the demand for cigarettes is inelastic, it means that consumers (smokers) are not very responsive to price changes. They will continue to buy cigarettes even if the price increases significantly. This is often the case with addictive goods like cigarettes.

- **Elasticity of Supply**: If the supply is more elastic compared to the demand, producers (tobacco companies) can more easily adjust the quantity they supply in response to price changes.

Given these points, smokers, who have a highly inelastic demand, would bear most of the tax burden. This is because they are less likely to reduce their consumption despite the price increase. Non-smokers are not directly affected by the tax on cigarettes, and tobacco companies can pass a significant portion of the tax onto consumers due to the inelastic nature of demand.

In summary, smokers would bear the highest percentage of the tax incidence because their demand for cigarettes is relatively inelastic compared to the other groups involved.",MGT_404 2023_final_exam_solutions.pdf,1,19810,13478,6026,262,1043,"doc_type=exam, year=2023",40,hybrid_full_doc,False,10,0,1.25,10,"[10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[""MGT_404 2023_final_exam_solutions.pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2023_final_exam_solutions.pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2023_final_exam_solutions.pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2023_final_exam_solutions.pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2023_final_exam_solutions.pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2023_final_exam_solutions.pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2023_final_exam_solutions.pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2023_final_exam_solutions.pdf|exam|unit:N/A""]",True,llm,11878,10,0,0.4034,"[""Directly contains question a) and its answer"", ""No relevant content related to question a)"", ""No relevant content related to question a)""]","[{""idx"": 0, ""file"": ""MGT_404 2023_final_exam_solutions.pdf"", ""score"": 0.527, ""text"": ""MGT 404 2023 Final Exam   1  FINAL EXAM Fall 2023   \u2022 This is a closed-book exam.
