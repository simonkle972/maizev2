Let the hardcore trainer’s total value for 4 classes be $V_H(4)$ and for 8 classes be $V_H(8)$. Then their surpluses are

$$
U_H(Basic)=V_H(4)-79

“Orange Theory is pricing OPTIMALLY” typically means the hardcore type’s INCENTIVE COMPATIBILITY constraint binds: Orange Theory sets the Elite price as high as possible while still making hardcore choose Elite over downgrading to Basic. If that constraint is binding, you can relate $U_H(Basic)$ directly to the given $U_H(Elite)=20$.

Write down the hardcore IC condition and use $U_H(Elite)=20$ to solve for what $U_H(Basic)$ must be.

Let a hardcore trainer’s total willingness to pay for $k$ classes be $V_H(k)$. Their consumer surplus from a plan is

$$
\text{Surplus} = V_H(k) - \text{Price}.
$$

You’re told for Elite (8 classes at $119$):

$$
V_H(8) - 119 = 25.
$$

Under optimal screening with a high type (hardcore) and low type (beginner), the high type’s INCENTIVE COMPATIBILITY constraint typically binds, meaning the hardcore trainer is indifferent between Elite and Basic:

$$
V_H(8) - 119 = V_H(4) - 79.
$$

Use the two equations above to solve for the hardcore trainer’s surplus on the Basic plan, $V_H(4) - 79$.

“Pricing optimally” is what tells you whether it is strict or indifference: if $U_H(E) \gt U_H(B)$, then Orange Theory could raise the Elite fee a tiny bit, still keep hardcore on Elite, and increase profit. So in an optimum you typically expect the constraint to BIND:
