Let's break down each statement to help you understand the concepts:

1. **""Except for rare cases, the demand curve is always downward sloping.""**
   - Generally, demand curves are downward sloping because as the price of a good decreases, the quantity demanded typically increases. This reflects the law of demand. However, there are exceptions, such as Giffen goods, where the demand curve might slope upward.

2. **""A firm’s average cost curve describes its supply function.""**
   - The average cost curve shows the cost per unit of output, but it does not directly describe the supply function. The supply function is more closely related to the marginal cost curve, as firms decide how much to supply based on the marginal cost equating to the market price.

3. **""Membership pricing extracts all surplus from consumers and therefore is always optimal.""**
   - Membership pricing can extract more consumer surplus by charging a fixed fee for access and then a price per unit. However, whether it is always optimal depends on the market structure and consumer preferences.

4. **""The demand for a product is less elastic when there are more substitutes.""**
   - This statement is generally false. The demand for a product is more elastic when there are more substitutes available because consumers can easily switch to alternatives if the price rises.

Consider these explanations and think about whether each statement is true or false based on the principles of economics. If you have any more questions about these concepts, feel free to ask!","MGT_404 2024_final_exam (1).pdf, MGT_404 2024_final_exam (1).pdf, MGT_404 2024_final_exam (1).pdf",8,19340,12212,6809,265,28,"doc_type=exam, year=2024",28,filtered,False,10,0,1.25,10,"[10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[""MGT_404 2024_final_exam (1).pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2024_final_exam (1).pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2024_final_exam (1).pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2024_final_exam (1).pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2024_final_exam (1).pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2024_final_exam (1).pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2024_final_exam (1).pdf|exam|unit:N/A"", ""MGT_404 2024_final_exam (1).pdf|exam|unit:N/A""]",True,llm,11498,10,0,0.4424,"[""Directly contains question a) from section 1."", ""No relevant content related to question a) from se"", ""No relevant content related to question a) from se""]","[{""idx"": 0, ""file"": ""MGT_404 2024_final_exam (1).pdf"", ""score"": 0.5191, ""text"": ""MGT 404 2023 Final Exam   1  FINAL EXAM Fall 2024   \u2022 This is a closed-book exam.
