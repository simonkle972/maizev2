The question asks about calculating demand and supply elasticity at the equilibrium of 2021, and determining which one is more elastic.

**Elasticity** is a measure of how much the quantity demanded or supplied responds to a change in price. It can be calculated for both demand and supply using the following formulas:

1. **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**:
   \[
   \text{PED} = \frac{\text{Percentage change in quantity demanded}}{\text{Percentage change in price}}
   \]
   The formula in terms of derivatives is:
   \[
   \text{PED} = \frac{dQ_d}{dp} \cdot \frac{p}{Q_d}
   \]
   Here, \(dQ_d/dp\) is the derivative of the demand function with respect to price.

2. **Price Elasticity of Supply (PES)**:
   \[
   \text{PES} = \frac{\text{Percentage change in quantity supplied}}{\text{Percentage change in price}}
   \]
   The formula in terms of derivatives is:
   \[
   \text{PES} = \frac{dQ_s}{dp} \cdot \frac{p}{Q_s}
   \]
   Here, \(dQ_s/dp\) is the derivative of the supply function with respect to price.

To find the elasticities at equilibrium, you will first need to solve for the equilibrium price and quantity using the supply and demand equations provided:
- Demand: \(Q_d(p) = 600 - 30p\)
- Supply: \(Q_s(p) = 300 + 70p\)

Once you have the equilibrium price and quantity, you can plug these values into the elasticity formulas above. Compare the absolute values of PED and PES to determine which one is more elastic (i.e., which one has a larger absolute value).

However, I can help guide you with general concepts and problem-solving strategies related to what we do see in problem 2 regarding airline tickets.

For problem 2, we are dealing with supply and demand for airline tickets. The key concepts likely involve understanding how price and quantity are determined at equilibrium and how changes, such as subsidies, affect the market.

Here's a brief summary of the concepts that might be relevant:

1. **Equilibrium**: This is where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. You can find equilibrium price and quantity by setting the supply and demand equations equal to each other.

2. **Elasticity**: This measures how much quantity demanded or supplied responds to changes in price. It's calculated as the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price.

3. **Subsidies**: A subsidy shifts the supply curve downwards (or to the right) by the amount of the subsidy, thus affecting the equilibrium price and quantity.

To approach this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Original Equilibrium**: You should have already calculated the equilibrium price and quantity without the subsidy from earlier parts of the problem set.

2. **Adjust the Supply Curve for Subsidy**: The subsidy reduces the cost for suppliers, effectively shifting the supply curve downward by the amount of the subsidy. If the original supply function is \( Q_s(p) = 300 + 70p \), the new supply function with a $2 subsidy per unit will be \( Q_s(p) = 300 + 70(p + 2) \).

3. **Find the New Equilibrium**: Set the new supply function equal to the demand function \( Q_d(p) = 600 - 30p \) to find the new equilibrium price and quantity.

4. **Calculate the Total Subsidy**: Multiply the subsidy per unit by the equilibrium quantity found with the subsidy to determine the total amount of subsidy.

5. **Consumer Surplus and Deadweight Loss**: 
   - **Consumer Surplus**: This is the area below the demand curve and above the price level up to the quantity consumed. Calculate it using the new equilibrium price.
   - **Deadweight Loss**: This occurs if there is inefficiency introduced by the subsidy, typically represented by the triangle between the new and old supply curves and the demand curve.

By following these steps, you can analyze the impact of the subsidy on the market.

To tackle this problem, you need to understand how a subsidy affects the supply curve. A per-unit subsidy effectively lowers the cost of production for suppliers by the subsidy amount, which shifts the supply curve downward by that same amount.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Identify the Original Supply Curve**: The original supply function given is \( Q_s(p) = 300 + 70p \).

2. **Understand the Effect of the Subsidy**: With a $2 per-unit subsidy, the suppliers receive $2 more for each unit sold than the price paid by consumers. This effectively reduces the price from the suppliers' perspective by $2.

3. **Adjust the Supply Curve**: To find the new supply curve, adjust the price in the supply equation. Substitute \( p - 2 \) for \( p \) in the original supply equation because the suppliers now act as if the price is $2 higher than it actually is.

This will give you the effective supply curve after the subsidy. Work through the algebra to find the new equation, and that will be your answer for part 2c.
