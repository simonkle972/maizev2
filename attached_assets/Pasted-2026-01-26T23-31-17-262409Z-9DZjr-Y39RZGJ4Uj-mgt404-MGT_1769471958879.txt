The question involves a local brewery using both machines (m) and labor (l) to make their product. The marginal return on investments (MPI) for labor is 0.06, and for machines, it is 0.05. The task is to determine how they should adjust their investment plan.

Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Marginal Return on Investment**: This is a measure of how much additional output is gained from investing one more unit in a particular input (in this case, labor or machines).

2. **Comparison of MPIs**: When comparing the MPI for labor (0.06) and machines (0.05), the MPI for labor is higher. This suggests that each additional unit of investment in labor yields a higher return compared to machines.

3. **Optimal Allocation**: To maximize returns, the brewery should consider reallocating their resources. Since labor has a higher MPI, they should invest more in labor and less in machines until the MPIs are equalized. This would ensure that the marginal benefit per unit cost is the same across both inputs, which is a condition for optimal allocation of resources in production.

So, the brewery should adjust their plan by investing more in labor and less in machines to equalize the MPIs. Let me know if you need further clarification on any of these points!"
