The short answer question you're referring to asks about the effect of an increase in expected inflation on stock prices.

The statement is: ""Suppose the expected inflation rate suddenly rises from 2% to 4%. The rise in inflation will cause stock prices to fall.""

To assess this statement, consider the following:

1. **Impact of Inflation on Interest Rates:** When inflation expectations increase, central banks might raise interest rates to combat inflation. Higher interest rates can lead to higher discount rates for future cash flows, reducing the present value of those cash flows.

2. **Effect on Stock Prices:** If the present value of future cash flows decreases, the intrinsic value of stocks would also decrease, leading to a fall in stock prices. This is because investors require a higher return to compensate for the increased inflation risk.

3. **Corporate Earnings:** Inflation can also affect corporate earnings. While some companies may pass on higher costs to consumers, others may see their profit margins compressed if they cannot fully do so. This uncertainty can further pressure stock prices.

In summary, consider how inflation affects interest rates, discount rates, and corporate earnings, and how these factors collectively impact stock prices. Based on this understanding, you should be able to justify whether you believe the statement is true, false, or uncertain."	final_2024.pdf	1	23850	16234	7284	225	491	doc_type=exam	27	hybrid_full_doc	False	5	0	0.625	5	[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]	["final_2024.pdf|exam|unit:N/A", "final_2024.pdf|exam|unit:N/A", "final_2023.pdf|exam|unit:N/A", "final_2024.pdf|exam|unit:N/A", "final_2023.pdf|exam|unit:N/A", "final_2024.pdf|exam|unit:N/A", "final_2024.pdf|exam|unit:N/A", "final_2023.pdf|exam|unit:N/A"]	True	llm	14949	5	0	0.3748	["Contains a question c but from a different context", "No reference to question c from the 2024 final.", "No reference to question c from the 2024 final."]	[{"idx": 0, "file": "final_2024.pdf", "score": 0.5284, "text": "t.\u201d \u2022You can receive partial credit for incorrect answers only if you show your work. \u2022More challenging subparts of questions are indicated with asterisks (**).
