The scenario involves Dyson's cordless vacuum, where you have data on price changes and the corresponding changes in sales volume.

Here's a step-by-step guide to approach this type of problem:

1. **Understand Elasticity**: Price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good. It's calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.

2. **Calculate Percentage Changes**:
   - **Price Change**: You have the initial price and the new price. Calculate the percentage change in price using the formula: \((\text{New Price} - \text{Old Price}) / \text{Old Price}\).
   - **Quantity Change**: Similarly, calculate the percentage change in quantity using: \((\text{New Quantity} - \text{Old Quantity}) / \text{Old Quantity}\).

3. **Elasticity Formula**: Once you have the percentage changes, use the elasticity formula: 
   \[
   \text{Elasticity} = \frac{\text{Percentage Change in Quantity}}{\text{Percentage Change in Price}}
   \]

4. **Interpretation**: An elasticity of -1 suggests unitary elasticity, meaning that total revenue remains constant when the price changes. If the elasticity is greater than -1 (in absolute terms), demand is inelastic; if less than -1, it is elastic.

5. **Optimal Pricing**: The question also asks whether $599 is an optimal price. Consider that if marginal cost is positive, the markup should be less than 1. If demand elasticity at $599 is approximately -1, it suggests that the price is optimal given the marginal cost and pricing rules.

Use these steps to calculate and interpret the demand elasticity based on the data provided in the question. If you need more detailed help with calculations, try working through the percentage change formulas and see if you can determine the elasticity value."

However, if you're working on a problem involving marginal returns on investments (MPI) for labor and machines, here's a general approach you can consider:

In such problems, the goal is often to optimize the allocation of resources between two inputs, in this case, labor and machines. The key is to compare the marginal returns of the two inputs:

1. **Understand the Marginal Return of Investment (MPI):** This tells you how much additional output (or value) you get from investing one more unit in either labor or machines. 

2. **Current MPI Values:** The problem states that the MPI for labor is 0.06, and for machines, it is 0.05.

3. **Optimization Strategy:** To maximize output or value, you should allocate more resources to the input with the higher MPI. In this case, since the MPI for labor is higher than that for machines, the firm should consider increasing investment in labor and reducing investment in machines.

4. **Equating MPIs:** The optimal point is typically when the MPIs of both inputs are equal, meaning the firm should adjust their usage of labor and machines until the additional value from the last unit of labor equals that of the last unit of machines.

I hope this helps you understand the approach to solving such a problem! If you have further questions or need clarification on specific concepts, feel free to ask."

The problem provides information on two types of membership plans—Basic and Elite—and the surplus that hardcore trainers experience.

To approach this type of problem, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the Pricing Strategy:**
   - The Basic plan costs $79 per month and offers 4 classes.
   - The Elite plan costs $119 per month and provides 8 classes.
   - Hardcore trainers have a higher reservation price for each class and demand more classes than beginners.

2. **Identify Surplus Information:**
   - You are told that hardcore trainers have a surplus of $25 if they choose the Elite plan.
   
3. **Indifference Condition:**
   - If Orange Theory is pricing optimally, hardcore trainers should be indifferent between the two plans. This means their surplus should be the same for both plans.

4. **Determine the Surplus for the Basic Plan:**
   - Since hardcore trainers have a surplus of $25 with the Elite plan, in an optimal pricing strategy, their surplus with the Basic plan would also be $25 to ensure they are indifferent between the two options.

This setup assumes that the pricing strategy is designed to extract maximum consumer surplus while keeping the high-value customers indifferent between the available plans, thereby encouraging them to choose the more profitable plan for Orange Theory."
